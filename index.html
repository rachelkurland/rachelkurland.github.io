            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Rachel Kurland and I am a proud Florida Gator and journalism junior at the University of Florida. I also intend to take a minor in Jewish studies.</p>
            <p>I have lived in Jacksonville, Fla., for most of my life, but I hope to expand my horizons and move to a big city to explore and learn.</p>
            <p>My aspirations began in the fourth grade when my class dressed up for career day. I, of course, wore a button-down shirt and a pencil behind my ear, embodying my best journalist pose.</p>
            <p>By middle school, I was enlightened again. I want to be a journalist because I have always been interested in it. But in all honesty, I have to give credit for my inspiration to one of my favorite TV shows, “Gilmore Girls.” Yes, this may sound ridiculous, but as a young pre-teen, I thought Rory Gilmore was the coolest young reporter ever, and I wanted to be just like her. I have no shame in admitting that. And I suppose it all really started from there on.</p>
            <p>Some day, I would like to write for magazines. Storytelling is a passion of mine, but it is not the only one. Judaism is a huge part of my life, and I wouldn’t be who I am today without the crazy youth group gatherings, homemade matzo ball soup and the pressure from my mother to marry a “nice Jewish boy.” Ideally, I would like to combine the best of both of my worlds and work for a Jewish magazine, but my love for storytelling spreads across all topics in all forms. Whether I write in print or on the Web, I know this is the right path for me. </p>
