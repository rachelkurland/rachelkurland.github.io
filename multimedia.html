            <h1>Student holds true to Jewish career goals</h1>
            <h5><em>-A multimedia story by Rachel Kurland-</em></h5>
            <h5><em>(Jewish topics like this story pertain to Rachel Kurland's specialization. This is an example of her work.)</em></h5>
                <p></p>
                <p>Jamie Fisher knew exactly what she wanted to be when she grew up, or so she thought.</p>
                <p>“I wanted to be the stork,” she said. “I was completely convinced that I wanted to deliver babies, and by delivering babies, I meant that I wanted to fly around and have them in boxes and drop them on doorsteps.”</p>
                <p>Once discovering the truth behind the stork, she decided on another career move: the papacy.</p>
                <p>“I really liked the hat,” she said.</p>
                <p>After some thought and actual growing up, Fisher eventually decided on a trade that she has been raised in all her life: a rabbi. The road to discovering a self-identity was not so easy for Fisher. In fact, the 19-year-old said these career choices didn’t always come so easily to her.</p>
                <p>Fisher was born in Massachusetts, but spent most of her life in Wellington, Fla., with a close-knit family, including her mother, her younger brother, David, and her cat, Harry. Her family joined different congregations over the years, both conservative and reform, but ended up in the reform congregation Temple Beth Torah.</p>

                <p>Fisher became a Bat Mitzvah there, which initially sparked her inspiration for Judaism. She realized she wanted to become a cantor.</p>
                <p>“I’ve had a totally Jewish upbringing,” she said. “For the longest time, it really didn’t affect me at all. Then I decided, ‘oh wait, I actually like this stuff.’”</p>
                <p>Since Fisher’s Bat Mitzvah in 2008, her aspirations have been set in stone to become a cantor. A cantor is a conductor of sorts who sings and leads the congregation in prayer. She thought about becoming a rabbi, but she said becoming a cantor was almost forced upon her. Several people told her she would be an excellent cantor, so she started to believe it.</p>
                <p>“I’m a singer,” Fisher said. “I love Judaism. Singing and Judaism just sort of make a cantor.”</p>
                <p>Fisher believed this up until Yom Kippur of 2012. As a freshman at the University of Florida, Jamie co-led Yom Kippur services at UF Hillel alongside another student and a guest rabbi, Melissa Zalkin Stollman. Fisher found peace looking out to the sea of students and friends dressed to the nines as they swayed to the soft sound of prayer.</p> 
                <p>At the end of the service, Zalkin Stollman gave Fisher a note that led to a whirlwind of reflection: “You know Jamie, you’d be a great cantor, but you’d be an amazing rabbi.” Though only meeting for a brief moment, this tidbit of advice awakened an idea in Fisher that she had never considered before.</p>
                <p>On Yom Kippur, the day of contemplation and atonement, Fisher experienced her own personal struggles. She had everything planned out. She was going to graduate from UF, go to cantorial school and become a cantor for a congregation. Now everything she planned for her life was ultimately questioned and unknown.</p>
                <p>“I cried and called my mom,” Fisher said. “She told me that my rabbi and cantor (from Wellington) had both said the exact same thing to her in the past two weeks.”</p>
                <p>With more support on the rabbinical route, Fisher still fought an inner battle. Several tissue boxes and a month later, Jamie realized her mentors would not say such a statement without truly meaning it.</p>
                <p>“They see the leadership potential in me. I guess I just have that little spark that’s warm to people. I love my decision now. I would never go back.”</p>
                <p>After making a huge life decision, her family made a huge life decision for her.</p>
                <p>Fisher was excited to be completed with her first semester at UF, especially because she was planning on going to Israel that winter break with Taglit-Birthright Israel, a free 10-day trip to Israel for young Jewish adults. However, her excitement for the holy land was halted when she came home.</p>
                <p>Her father passed away the following Monday after Thanksgiving, but no one told her the news until she returned home in December in hope to not disrupt her focus on her schoolwork during final exams. Fisher’s father was half-Jewish, but he didn’t practice Judaism often. When she was 10 years old, he left his family. Fisher did not have much of a relationship with him. With only a week to process this shocking information before she left for Israel, Fisher said she did not have enough time to digest how casually the situation was handled.</p>
                <p>After a 10-hour plane ride, Fisher arrived in her (now) favorite place in the world. She bottled her emotions and stinging pain about her father. Halfway through the trip, the bottle exploded with an eruption of blazing and fervent sensations.</p>
                <p>“Nobody knew until Shabbat when they asked me to lead services. We got to the Mourner’s Kaddish, and I had a mental breakdown and ran out of the room crying.”</p>
                <p>The Mourner’s Kaddish is a prayer of bereavement said for lost loved ones. This prayer provoked the painful pent up emotions Fisher was going though. With the comfort of her fellow trip members, Fisher grieved openly and gained some closure.</p>
                <p>Fisher said the overall best part of the trip was the people she met, and she remains close with them today. The excursion and the friendships  renews her love for Judaism.</p>
                <p>“Your trip is a family,” she said. “You become a family.It’s just such a great way to connect to people.”</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Fisher’s religious connection to others began with her rabbi and cantor at Temple Beth Torah. Rabbi Stephen Pinsky provided her with books on Judaic literature and understandings of Talmud after his retirement, and Fisher said they usually get lunch when she comes back to town. Her musical inspirations stemmed from Cantor Carrie Barry, who guided her in musical choices and different forms of chanting prayers.</p>
                <p>Barry, who has been a cantor at Temple Beth Torah for eight years, was thrilled when she heard Fisher would strive to become a rabbi.</p>
                <p>“That was my dream for her,” she said. “She’s very passionate about Judaism.” Barry said there are more doors open for a rabbi than a cantor because a rabbi can technically do almost the same types of community leading as a cantor, but not the other way around. “You can still sing when you’re the rabbi.”</p>
                <p>Barry said becoming a rabbi is a long process. After receiving a bachelor’s degree, students must attend a five-year rabbinical program, which Fisher described as “rabbi grad school.” For future reform rabbis like Fisher, most attend Hebrew Union College- Jewish Institute of Religion. However, the first year of study is abroad in Jerusalem, while the other four are spent on campuses in New York, Cincinnati or Los Angeles. Students enroll in courses that pertain to Hebrew, Torah, Talmud, Midrash and pastoral care. They also work in a local congregation as student rabbis and engage with all aspects of the Jewish community, including children and elderly.</p>
                <p>“Women’s voices are extremely important in the progression of Judaism,” Barry said. Female rabbis are still an upcoming phenomenon in the Reform Movement that is reaching popularity. The enrichment of Jewish traditions is reinforced through a different sensitivity and perspective women portray, Barry said.</p>
                <p>According to a study by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, approximately 600 women have become reform rabbis since 1972, and there are a total of about 2,000 reform rabbis in North America.</p>
                <p>Rabbi Gail Swedroe, assistant director and campus rabbi at UF Hillel, said gender should not make a difference in how a rabbi leads and teaches people.</p>
                <p>“One’s gender doesn’t matter just as it wouldn’t make a difference if one were a male or female doctor or male or female teacher,” Swedroe said. She said what really matters is how they build holy communities and make the traditions relevant to people.</p>
                <p>“Anyone can Google what something is or how to observe a holiday. Google can’t form a community that is there for you to celebrate in good times or comfort you in bad. Google can’t tell you how to take the tradition and find relevance in it for today’s world. That’s something that people need to do as a community, and rabbis are privileged to often be the ones guiding a community through this process.”</p>
                <p>Fisher said she constantly gets asked if women can be rabbis.</p>
                <p>“I try not to focus on the fact that I’m a woman doing it,” she said. “It will mean a lot to continue a movement, but for me personally, I don’t really ever think about the fact that I’m a woman doing this.”</p>
                <p>What Fisher does think about, however, is the significance of music incorporated into services. Music is an important aspect of her life. She was in her high school chorus and is a member of the UF Women’s Chorale. Fisher said her favorite part of Shabbat services is when the congregation sings along to the prayers and songs.</p>
                <p>“I love looking out when we’re doing the silent prayer,” Fisher added. “I see people either looking at me or they’re giggling. Just knowing that they’re there because they want to be is really important.”</p>
                <p>Fisher is currently a sophomore at UF. She is studying Jewish studies and anthropology with a minor in leadership and history. Whatever the future holds for Fisher, she said she is excited to experience the journey.</p>
                <p>“I love the responsibility of (being a rabbi),” she said. “I love being able to know that people are counting on me and that I can help other people.”</p>
